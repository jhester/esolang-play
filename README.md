Esoteric Language Playground
=============

Simple Brainf*ck, Ook!, Deadfish, and Befunge-93 interpreters written in JavaScript. 

Brainf*ck / Ook! observes most of the suggestions from [
The Epistle to the Implementors.](http://www.hevanet.com/cristofd/brainfuck/epistle.html) to create a better experience. 

Deadfish is completely awful, I think my interpretation captures that.

As for Befunge, it is a beautiful language, but my interpreter is pretty crappy. Purely an academic exercise. Enjoy! (sarcasm)
